How To Play:

The object of the game is to bounce the ball through all the light-colored targets in each level; once you do, you advance to the next level. But beware of the little dark-colored targets! Hit one of those, and you'll have to restart the level. The higher the level, the more targets there are -- both good and bad.
Use your mouse to move the left paddle up or down. The ball can also bounce off of any of the four walls.
